=head1 NAME

App::Mayhem::View - A herder of dialogs.  This object creates the

and destroying toplevel dialogs as needed to help the user use the program.
This object manages the TCP socket object that is used to communicate with the
controller object L<App::Mayhem>.

    my $gui_thread = threads->create(
        sub {
            require App::Mayhem::View;
            import App::Mayhem::View;
            App::Mayhem::View->run();
        } # sub
    );
    $gui_thread->detatch();

Optional arguments:

=over

=item server_port => [port number]

Port number that the controller object is listening to.

=item server_address => [IPv4 address]

The C<new()> method initializes the UI Manager object and causes it to connect
to the server on the specified address/port and wait for the server to issue
commands.

Required arguments: None.

Transfer control to the UI Manager object.  Does not return program execution
to the caller; this method is meant to be called under a separate process
thread, which can then be detatched.
